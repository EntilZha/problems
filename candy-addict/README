This is a coding challenge, the link can be found inside the code file. My goal was twofold, I wanted to first solve the problem using Go,
then see how much GoRoutines could speed up. Since the simulation is sequential the chance for go routines is to run multiple simulations
in parallel. With a small number of test cases which aren't very large, this gives a decent boost on a 4 core machine. You can try it yourself
by using

go test -bench=. -run=XXX -parallel=1 -cpu=4

where -cpu=4 is replaced with the number of cores your machine has
